## 🚨 Use Cases

### 🛡️ Safety Features
- **Immediate SOS:** Automatically sends an emergency alert via **Twilio** to emergency services in case of an accident, including:
  - User information
  - Real-time location of the crash
- **False Alarm Prevention:** Intelligent filtering to prevent false triggers using sensor data.

### 🤖 AI Features
- **Voice Assistant with MCP Integration:**
  - Hands-free voice control for essential tasks while riding.
  - Seamless interaction powered by the **Model Context Protocol** and **Gemini API**.

- **Delivery Driver Use Case (Zomato Mock Integration):**
  - We built a mock **Zomato server** to simulate real-world delivery scenarios.
  - The rider can:
    - Place orders
    - Cancel orders
    - Check order status  
  — all through **natural language voice commands**.
